In today’s world, the fashion industry has a strong importance in people’s lives. The fashion industry say to the society what to wear and creates new types of clothes all the time.  
Some people claim that the fashion industry has a bad effect on people’s lives, they say that the fashion industry creates clothes that the society has to wear. Furthermore, the clothes’ price is extremely high and people, who can’t afford it, should not be in the society.  
In the other hand, the fashion industry guide the people to be in a good appearance, because, nowadays, the appearance of the person is more important than the person itself.

**Passsage 1**  
Every country in the world suffers environmental catastrophes. This is a natural consequence of the struggle between development and environment. If a country decided to live isolated from the rest of the world, living on what it can naturally grow and produce, it surely wouldn’t be highly polluted. But we all want exotic food and technological items from all over the world, so we have to pay the price. Investing on electrical transport would benefit the environment a lot. Even more if this electricity came from a natural source of energy like wind, rivers and solar boards. We also have to take care of our rivers and seas. We all have heard about factories throwing highly toxic substances to rivers, without minimizing their poisoning effects. A really strict law should be applied to fine these factories and make them change their policy.

**Passsage 2**  
Global warming is a serious issue that affects the entire planet. The Earth's temperature is rising because of human activities. When we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, harmful gases are released into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth to become warmer. This leads to various problems such as melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. It is important to reduce our carbon footprint by using less energy and finding cleaner sources of power. We can also make a difference by recycling, conserving water, and protecting natural habitats. Taking action against global warming is crucial for the well-being of our planet and future generations.

**Passsage 3**  
Society has a responsibility to take care of the environment. We all live on this planet, so it's important for us to do our part to keep it clean and healthy. There are many things we can do to be environmentally responsible. We should recycle our waste, such as paper, plastic, and cans, instead of throwing them away. It's also important to save energy by turning off lights and appliances when we're not using them. Using public transportation or carpooling can help reduce pollution from cars. We should also avoid wasting water and try to conserve it. Planting trees and taking part in community clean-up activities are great ways to contribute to a cleaner environment. By being environmentally responsible, we can make a positive impact on our planet and ensure a better future for ourselves and future generations.
